# Wolf Scheduler
This is my wolf schduler project. This is a java application that implements OOP, Unit Testing, System Testing, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract and Interface classes. This project uses file IO to read from a CSV containg courses and imports them into a catalog that the user can pick from. The user will be picking out courses so they are able to create and export their own custom schedule. They are also able to add custom events into the schedule such as a lunch. The scheduler has rules when creating a schedule for example you are not allowed to be enrolled in the same class twice or have overlapping times.

This project was my first introduction in inheritance, and interface classes and really shows me how you can compress your class files into a set heirachy and redule a lot of redundancy in your files.

This project is an import from my school GitHub account.
